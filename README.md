# Financial-Fraud-with-Random-Forests-R-Code
The R code used in an MSci investigation into the applications of ensemble machine learning for financial fraud detection. 

Fraudulent credit card transactions cost the UK economy billions every year. There-
fore, it is essential that the most accurate and effcient fraud detection algorithms be
used to minimise these losses. The statistical theory of classiffcation techniques plays
a key role in forming a basis for these detection algorithms, and with the up incoming
interest in the areas of big data analytics and cyber security, classiffcation techniques
such as random forests have indeed developed into a subject of keen interest. Obtaining
a successful algorithm, however, can be a challenging process, as only a small minority
of transactions are often classed as fraudulent by the investigators, which then leads to
an unbalanced distribution of the target variable that eventually causes a decrease in
the overall accuracy of the detection algorithms. That is why this project will be based
primarily on boosting the effciency and advancing the typical back-end statistical de-
tection methods and classiffcation techniques used to prevent fraudulent activity, while
also considering the implementation of additional strategies that have been employed
successfully in other industries.
